/******************************************************************************
    PRSD Encryption/Decryption Library

    PRSD files are effectively just encrypted PRS files with a small header on
    the top defining the decompressed size of the file and the encryption key.
    The encryption employed for this is the same that is used for packets in
    PSO for Dreamcast and PSOPC (as well as the patch server for PSOBB).

    This is a new, clean implementation of the PSO for Dreamcast/PSOPC
    encryption code. While libpsoarchive could very well use the same encryption
    code used by the rest of Sylverant, that would either imply duplicating the
    code in this library or having a dependency on libsylverant. I will not
    make libpsoarchive dependent on libsylverant for (somewhat) obvious reasons.
    I chose to reimplement the encryption code from scratch to hopefully make it
    a little bit easier to follow than the code that Fuzziqer put out (and I use
    in libsylverant). That code is (quite obviously) almost directly the result
    of disassembling Sega's code and decompiling it. This code works
    equivalently, but is (to me, anyway) a bit easier to understand.

    While this code could (in theory) be used outside of the PRSD decopmression
    code, that is not the intent here (hence why the context structure is in a
    non-installed header file).
