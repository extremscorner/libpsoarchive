/* Compress a buffer with PRS compression.

   This function compresses the data in the src buffer into a new buffer. This
   function will never produce output larger than that of the prs_archive
   function, and will usually beat that function rather significantly.

   In testing, the compressed output of this function actually beats Sega's own
   compression slightly (by 100 bytes or so on an uncompressed version of the
   ItemPMT.prs from PSO Episode I & II Plus).

   It is the caller's responsibility to free *dst when it is no longer in use.

   Returns a negative value on failure (specifically something from
   psoarchive-error.h). Returns the size of the compressed output on success.

   significantly.

   This function archives the data in the src buffer into a new buffer. This

   data (it does not actually compress the output. There's probably no good
   reason to ever use this, but it is here if you want it for some reason.
